Here are the standard commands you'll use for all future commits:
For regular commits (most common):
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message describing what you changed"
git push origin main

If you only want to commit specific files:
git add filename.py
git add another-file.js
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main


To see what files have changed before committing:
git status

To see what specific changes you made:
git diff

Example workflow:
# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new feature X and fix bug Y"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
